        <p>I completed my secondary education from Araniko Secondary School in 2019. During my time at school, I was actively involved in various extracurricular activities such as playing basketball and participating in science fairs. I was also a member of the school's science club, where I gained valuable experience in experimenting and presenting my findings. I was also part of kabaddi team and won the second place in the mayor cup that was organised at that time and all the schools all over the muncipality participated in it.</p>
        <p>I got 3.55 GPA in my SEE.</p>
